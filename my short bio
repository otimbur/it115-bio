Hello, my name is Olga Timbur. I am a student at Year Up going into the app development truck to learn new skills in the tech field. 
I developed my strong work ethic and team support in the medical area and communication and customer service through the banking industry.
Exploring different career paths consolidated my skills and determined my ultimate career goal.
I hope to present my desire to work in a company related to my values and personality as a software developer
